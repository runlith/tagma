The server's bottom floor, on which every other module stands. It owns the machine's and the graph's SQLite stores with their migrations, snapshots and write units, writer-session accounting, the shape in which a module declares itself and its operations with refusals and deadlines, the readable shape of values from schemas, the machine's capacity and shared machinery — file watching, the data-directory lock, durable writes and git primitives. It holds no subject knowledge: what to store and which operations to declare is decided by the modules above.
